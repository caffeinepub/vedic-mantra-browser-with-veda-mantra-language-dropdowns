# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the app to the Internet Computer (IC) mainnet and make it publicly accessible via a stable URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy both frontend and backend canisters to the IC mainnet with stable canister IDs.
- Add a root-level README (or equivalent) that documents the exact public URL for the deployed frontend canister.
- Add an in-app “Share” area that shows the current full page URL (including selected Veda/mantra path when present) and provides a copy-to-clipboard action with a visible English success state.

**User-visible outcome:** Anyone can open the app from a standard browser using the documented public URL, and users can copy/share the current page link directly from within the app.
