# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Move the Audio section to appear directly below the Mantra Text and above the Meaning when it is rendered.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the single-page UI layout so the Audio card (when shown for Samaveda, Mantra 47) renders immediately after the Mantra Text content card and before the Meaning card.
- Keep the Audio section’s existing behavior unchanged (upload/replace, playback, and loading/error/empty states), and keep all user-facing text in English.

**User-visible outcome:** When viewing Samaveda Mantra 47, the Audio section appears right below the mantra text and above the meaning; for all other selections, the Audio section remains hidden as it is today.
