  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented in App.tsx by converting Veda/Language Selects to string-controlled state and mapping those strings back to backend enums before querying. Due to App.tsx being truncated in the diff summary, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the REQ-2 Select-trigger display fix for Mantra Number and the REQ-3 user-visible diagnostic guardrails are fully implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Mantra Number dropdown trigger visibly displays the selected mantra number after auto-selection and manual selection, including deep-link behavior fallback when the deep-linked value is not in the fetched list.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows string state for `selectedMantraString` and deep-link parsing, but does not show the Mantra Number Select rendering logic (SelectTrigger/SelectValue) or any explicit guard to prevent a blank trigger when the controlled value mismatches available options. The relevant portion may be in the truncated section, but it is not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add user-visible English diagnostic guardrails in the mantra selection area when mantra numbers are unavailable/empty or when the selected mantra value does not match loaded options, and hide diagnostics during normal operation.",
      "reason": "Although App.tsx imports Alert components, the provided diff excerpt does not show any conditional diagnostic UI rendering that includes current Veda, loading state, count of loaded numbers, or mismatch messaging. This may exist in truncated content but is not verifiable from the diff summary.",
