  "summary": "The diff adds a MantraTemplatePreview component and updates query hooks/App logic to better handle null vs empty-string responses and reduce stale cached data, which plausibly addresses Mantra 48 rendering and template-preview fallback. However, App.tsx also includes unrequested deep-link/redirect URL parsing behavior (based on the visible truncated snippet).",
